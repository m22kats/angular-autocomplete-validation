# angular-autocomplete-validation
To ensure that a valid option is selected, this form input uses an autocomplete feature that displays a list of available options based on the user's input. As the user types, the input field provides suggestions that match the entered text.

To prevent submission without a valid selection, the form input also uses validation. The user must select one of the suggested options from the autocomplete list to satisfy the form's requirements.

This form input is implemented as part of a larger form group, and the input field is controlled by a form control. The use of an autocomplete component and form validation ensures that the form data is consistent and accurate.
